# rtic-ucl.github.io
Files for the new and improved RTIC website here.

[THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS]

index.html is the main page, which can be found at https://rtic-ucl.github.io/
style.css is the CSS page affecting the design - linking a different CSS document to index.html will affect the appearance of the website
script.js is the Javascript file that makes animations for the image slideshow

To add new sub-pages (child pages), make a new folder in github, then create a new "index.html" within that folder. It will have a url of the form https://rtic-ucl.github.io/foldername/
